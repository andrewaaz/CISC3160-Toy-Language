# Build Instructions 
To use this program, you must have the ghc compiler for haskell. 
1. `git clone https://github.com/andrewaaz/CISC3160-Toy-Language.git toylang`
2.  `cd toylang` 
3.  `ghc toy.hs` 

This should create an executable named toy, or toy.exe if you are building on windows. 

# Usage Instructions 
To interpret a toy language program, such as the two examples in this repository, you just run the build toy executable, giving the toy file you want to interpret as an argument 
For example: `./toy toytest2.txt`
